                <p>We well know that weather can make or break a trip to the wonderful
                    Pacific Northwest. Luckily on our site we have a specifically
                    designed tool called <b>'Differences'</b> to help you compare any 
                    local weather with the current weather in Seattle. All you need
                    is the zipcode of the location you would like to check and it will
                    display instantly. It will
                    not only give you the local weather, but also a direct comparison
                    between that and Seattle. We hope this helps you decide where to go
                    for your weekend excursion.

                    As long as you haven't been living under a rock for the past year
                    or so, you may well know that we are in the midst of a pandemic.
                    Both staying safe and getting out are very important, which is
                    where our <b>'Covid Info'</b> page comes in handy. This page will provide you
                    with the ability to search any location to see the current Covid
                    situation there. Our application will give you information about
                    how much of the population is impacted by the virus, and if it
                    would be safe for you to go. We hope you are still able to come enjoy
                    the wonderful Pacific Northwest.
